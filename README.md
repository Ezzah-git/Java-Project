Escape Room Puzzle Generator is a Java-based console game.
It dynamically generates unique puzzles and challenges that test your logic, observation, and problem-solving skills.
Players must solve each puzzle to "escape" within limited time.
The project is designed to be modular, so you can easily add new types of puzzles for a richer experience.
